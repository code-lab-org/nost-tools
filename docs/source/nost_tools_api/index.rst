NOS-T Tools API
---------------

This page contains descriptions of the NOS-T tools library features, and
provides a detailed description of their functions. Within this library, there are
templates to support both time-managed and time-agnostic applications.

These templates allow a user to create an application with unique functionality,
and easily ensure that the application will be compatible with the simulation as
a whole.

In this webpage, you can find the documentation for the provided templates, The
FireSat+ example codes show how the templates can be integrated into user applications.
The applications can be found in `this GitHub repository <https://github.com/code-lab-org/nost-tools/tree/main/nost_tools>`__.

Installation instructions are found at :ref:`this link <installation>`. A step-by-step guide for running FireSat+, including the installation 
instructions, is in the :ref:`tutorial`.

The tools library is an expansion of the NOS-T infrastructure project, intended to simplify
component interoperability for distributed systems testing. A deep dive into the NOS-T project
is in the :ref:`ICD`.
