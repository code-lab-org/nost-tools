NOS-T Science Event Test Suite
==============================

These two applications provide a basic demonstration on how to publish and
subscribe to topics with NOS-T. This example does not require the usage of the
NOS-T tools library. A step-by-step walkthrough can be found :ref:`here<instructionsScienceDash>`.

One of the applications, scienceEventPublisher.py produces a "science event"
which has a random location and consistent utility curve associated with it.
It publishes these events in a message payload to a topic over the event broker.

The second application, scienceEventDashboard, subcribes to this topic and
then creates a visual dashboard to see the current "science utility" at each
simulation time step. These dashboards have been helpful for the development
team in ensuring that test behavior is as expected.
