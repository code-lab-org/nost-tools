Example Test Suites
===================

These three example test suites demonstrate both managed and unmanaged application use cases.
Descriptions of the each node is found via the links below. 

The :ref:`Science Event Dashboard<instructionsScienceDash>` is a simple example with only two applications.

FireSat+ is a more complex and capable use case. It integrates the NOS-T tools library. There
is a step-by-step guide for running this test suite in the :ref:`tutorial`

Finally, the :ref:`Scalability Test Suite<scalability>` was used to test how well NOS-T can handle messages
loads of varying frequency and size.
