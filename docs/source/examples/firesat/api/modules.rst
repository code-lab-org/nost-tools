FireSat is a classic hypothetical space mission for identifying and monitoring forest fires, as presented in *Space Mission Analysis and Design, Third Edition* by James R. Wertz and Wiley J.

FireSat+ test suite with these example applications demonstrate how the NOS-T Tools can be used to leverage the testbed for evaluating different constellations of satellites for fire monitoring.
