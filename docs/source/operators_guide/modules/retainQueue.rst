Configuring a Solace Broker for Message Queueing
================================================

Although the MQTT protocol was not originally designed for message queueing, Solace Event Brokers are equipped to handle persistent sessions and queues on topic endpoints. Asynchronous queueing is possible with NOS-T, but it is more consistent when topic endpoints are mapped to the queues directly on the Solace Broker.
