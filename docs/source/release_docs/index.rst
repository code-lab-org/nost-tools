Release Documents
=================

The links below will lead you to some NOS-T official release documents. 
The Interface Control Document (ICD) is an in-depth look at the NOS-T
system architecture, the MQTT message protocol, unmanaged/managed
use cases, the NOS-T tools library, and a detailed starting guide.

The Technical Brief contains similar information to the ICD but in a more
concise format. 

If you're just getting started with NOS-T, the :ref:`tutorial` is a walk-through on using NOS-T.
